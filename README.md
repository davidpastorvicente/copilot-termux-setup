# GitHub Copilot CLI Setup for Termux

This repository contains a setup script to install and configure the **GitHub Copilot CLI** on **Termux** (Android). It automates the installation of system dependencies, builds required native modules, and sets up the environment for a smooth experience.

> **Important:** this branch intentionally targets the older **`@github/copilot` 1.0.45** path because it uses the faster Android-native Termux setup instead of the newer emulated workaround.

## Overview

The `setup.sh` script performs the following tasks:
- Installs Node.js and build tools (clang, make, python, rust).
- Installs system libraries (glib, libvips, pkg-config).
- Installs `@github/copilot@1.0.45` globally by default.
- Compiles and configures native Node.js modules:
  - **node-pty**: For pseudo-terminal support.
  - **sharp**: For image processing.
  - **keytar**: For secure credential storage.
- Sets up a clipboard wrapper using `termux-api`.
- Configures `ripgrep` for code search.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download the `setup.sh` file to your Termux home directory.
2.  Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
3.  Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

The script will guide you through the installation process. It may take some time to compile the native modules.

If you want to be explicit, you can pin the version when running it:

```bash
COPILOT_VERSION=1.0.45 ./setup.sh
```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start the GitHub Copilot CLI by running:

```bash
copilot
```
